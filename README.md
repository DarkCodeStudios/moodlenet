You can find our main instance here at [moodle.net](https://moodle.net), but you can also run your own instance and help with development.  In the future we will be supporting a federated search across all instances. 

## Current Status

MoodleNet has just reached the 3.0 milestone, which largely involved architectural changes to support plugins.

We are now focussed on MoodleNet 4.0 which is focussed on a number of systems (including AI, gamification and use of metadata) to vastly improve how quality is identified and surfaced to you as a user.

## Documentation 

Our main documentation with everythinng you need to know is here:  [MoodleNet Docs](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/MoodleNet)

## Quick install tip

The easiest way to install and update your own instance is via NPM:  
```
npm create @moodlenet@latest path/to/installation/folder
```
